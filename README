Sample TypeScript with AMD application.

First you need to install npm, grunt and dependencies:

    npm install

Then you can compile TypeScript files:

    grunt typescript

When you want to build the concatenated file execute:

    grunt build

And you will get one file that contains everything: dist/scripts.js.

Now you can replace the script include in index.html

    <script src="scripts/lib/require.js" data-main="scripts/main"></script>

to use the minified file:

    <script src="dist/scripts.js" data-main="scripts/main"></script>
